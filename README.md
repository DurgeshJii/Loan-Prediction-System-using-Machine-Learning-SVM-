# Loan-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning-SVM-
This project implements a Loan Approval Prediction System using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant details.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and a real-time prediction system.

🚀 Key Features

Cleaned and preprocessed real-world loan dataset

Handled missing values and categorical variables

Performed data visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib

Implemented One-Hot Encoding for categorical features

Trained an SVM (Linear Kernel) classification model

Evaluated model using training and testing accuracy

Built a custom loan prediction function for new user inputs

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (SVM, Train-Test Split, Accuracy Score)

📊 Dataset Details

Total Records: 614

Features: Applicant income, loan amount, credit history, education, property area, etc.

Target Variable: Loan_Status (Approved / Not Approved)

📌 Model Performance

Training Accuracy: ~ High accuracy with linear SVM

Test Accuracy: ~ Consistent performance without overfitting

🔍 Use Case

This system can assist banks and financial institutions in automating loan approval decisions, reducing manual effort and improving decision accuracy.
